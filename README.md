# open-nvme
The original purpose of this project is to record my understanding of the nvme protocol and to develop and maintain a detachable nvme module with interested parties.

The NVM ExpressTM (NVMeTM) interface allows host software to communicate with a non-volatile memory subsystem.(from nvme specific)
